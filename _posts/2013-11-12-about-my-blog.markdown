Hi! My name is Denis Cormier and I am a computer programmer, game designer, and
videogame speedrunner. I also play Australian rules football.

I intend on making blog posts about all these interests. I will see if I can
somehow separate them while maintaining a place where all my posts can be seen.

Have a look at the following pages:

- [Austrlian rules football]({{ site.url }}/aussierules)
- [Videogame speedrunning]({{ site.url }}/speedrunning)
- [Game design]({{ site.url }}/gamedesign)

2015-11-19: Don't be surprised that the first actual blog post happened in 2015. It's true. I set this blog up 2 years
ago (almost to this very day!) with the intention of writing up something. Anything.

Really, it's ok. I haven't been blogging about things because I've been busy doing things. And when I wasn't doing
things, I was relaxing and pondering on what to do next instead of writing about what I just did (or just relaxing.
relaxing is nice).

I'm not a blogger. At least, I don't feel like one. However, inspiration comes in bursts. I just need to be ready with
keyboard in hand when inspiration comes busting through the door.
