Hi! My name is Denis Cormier and I am a computer programmer, game designer, and
videogame speedrunner. I also play Australian rules football.

I intend on making blog posts about all these interests. I will see if I can
somehow separate them while maintaining a place where all my posts can be seen.

Have a look at the following pages:

- [Computer programming]({{ site.url }}/programming)
- [Austrlian rules football]({{ site.url }}/aussierules)
- [Videogame speedrunning]({{ site.url }}/speedrunning)
