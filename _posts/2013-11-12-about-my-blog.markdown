Hi! My name is Denis Cormier and I am a computer programmer, Australian rules
football player, and videogame speedrunner.

I intend on making blog posts about all these three interests. I will see if I
can somehow separate them while maintaining a place where all my posts can be
seen.

Have a look at the following pages (however, they are not up yet):

- [Computer programming](http://deniscormier.github.io/programming)
- [Austrlian rules football](http://deniscormier.github.io/aussierules)
- [Videogame speedrunning](http://deniscormier.github.io/speedrunning)
